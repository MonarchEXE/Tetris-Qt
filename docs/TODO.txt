Tetroid collisions: 1 square can cause the tetroid to float
- Pixel collision (detect when an edge hits another edge)
- Grid collision (tetroid tries going to array loc == 1; stays above)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Drawing tetroids.
- File Input from /lib/Tetroids
- Image input resized (shrink to 20x20 px^2 per cube, but maintain OG dimensions)
- Tetroid drawn to window via QPixmap & QImage
- Tetroids fall set no. of pixels / set time
- Pause btn stops tetroids from falling

Tetris Game Logic
- Tetroids fall set no. of pixels / set time (e.g. seconds)
- Fall spd increases / time (difficulty setting)
- Tetroids can be rotated and preserved for future use
- 1 block collision can suspend entire tetroid.
- 1+ lines filled w/ blocks knocks it out, blocks above fall and fill space below
- Game ends once 1+ blocks go past top line (i.e. (X, 0))





Music and Audio elements are simply what the player hears during the videogame. This can range from character dialogue, background sound effects
and audio cues. Audio cues are certain sfx triggered by events (character moving causes footsteps, player shoots a gun plays a gunshot)
